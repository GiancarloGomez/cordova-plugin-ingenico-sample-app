# New Requests

* Add 3 Ingenico values to be passed in as arguments from JavaScript and not as xCode keys
* New Funciton -> Check for device connection
* New function -> manually disconnect device
* Create new page "manual" to demo working without the auto connect feature in case it gives issues in the future as we are both only testing with 1 device in the room
